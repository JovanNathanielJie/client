Hey Ella,
Affection isnâ€™t just about words. Itâ€™s about the warmth, care, and thoughtfulness we carry for someone special. And you, Ella, inspire all of that and more. Even from afar, I feel a closeness to you thatâ€™s gentle, comforting, and endlessly uplifting.

Every little thing about you. Your laugh, your smile, your kindness, your presence makes my heart want to treasure and care for you even more. Affection is how I want to show you that you matter, that you are seen, and that you are deeply cherished.

No matter what the day brings, I hope you always feel a gentle warmth surrounding you, a quiet reminder that someone out there thinks of you with care, admiration, and affection. Remember, if things get dire and tiring, you will have, at the very least, one person always supporting you all the way. Weâ€™ll celebrate your journey together at the finish line. Iâ€™m excited for that day!

With all my heart,
[Jojie]
            </p>
