Hey Ella,
You have a light within you. One that shines quietly but powerfully, touching everyone around you in ways you may not even notice. Itâ€™s in your smile, in your laugh, in the kindness and warmth you carry effortlessly. Even on cloudy days, your presence brings brightness, hope, and calm to those lucky enough to know you.

Life can sometimes feel heavy, and the world may dim around us, but your light never fades. It reminds me that beauty, joy, and love can exist even in the smallest moments. Never doubt it, Ella. Your light is one of the rarest gifts in this world, and it inspires more than you know. For me, you have been the brightest candle in my mind.

Keep shining, keep being your radiant self, and never underestimate the power of the light you carry within you. You make the world brighter simply by being in it.

Always cheering you on,
[Jojie]
            </p>
