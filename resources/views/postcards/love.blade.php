Hey Ella,
There’s a quiet kind of magic in the way I think of you. A warmth that lingers even in the smallest moments. Love isn’t always loud or grand. Sometimes it’s in the little things, the way your laugh lingers in my mind, the way your kindness touches everyone around you, the way simply you being you makes the world a brighter place.

I hope you know that you are cherished, admired, and truly loved. Not just for what you do, but for who you are. Every smile, every thought, every small act of yours is a reminder of the beauty you carry in your heart.

Even if I can’t always be there in person, I want you to feel it. The love that surrounds you, the love that sees you in all your brilliance, the love that celebrates you endlessly. You are remarkable, Ella, and you are so, so loved, just for being you. There’s never been a doubt in my mind that you’re one of the greatest human beings I’ve ever met.

You’re incredible! Don’t you ever forget about that, yeah?

With all my heart,
[Jojie]
