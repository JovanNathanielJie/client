Hey Ella,
I hope this little note finds you smiling, even if just a tiny bit. I wanted to remind you today and every day, that you are stronger, braver, and more incredible than you often give yourself credit for. Life can feel heavy sometimes, and the world can be loud and overwhelming, but I see how you keep going, how you shine through, even when things get tough.

Every step you take, every choice you make, even the small, quiet ones, they matter. They show your courage, your heart, and your determination. And even when things donâ€™t go exactly as planned, remember that itâ€™s okay to pause, to breathe, to gather strength. You donâ€™t have to rush. You donâ€™t have to be perfect. Just being you is more than enough, and itâ€™s already extraordinary.

Whenever you feel unsure or doubt yourself, think of this: you have a spark inside you that can light up the darkest rooms, a warmth that makes those around you feel seen and cared for, and a heart that has already touched more lives than you realize. Keep trusting yourself, keep dreaming, and keep believing that you are capable of amazing things, because you truly are. You deserve the world, Ella. Iâ€™m damn proud of you!

I believe in you, Ella, today and always.

Your biggest fan,
[Jojie]
            </p>
